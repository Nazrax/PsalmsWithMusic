tune: Darwall's 148th
name: Psalm 92

1_It's good to thank the Lord,
To praise Your name, Most High!
2_To show Your love at dawn,
Your faith -- ful -- ness all night!
3_The ten -- stringed lyre
With sweet -- voiced lute and rip -- pling harp
Your praise in -- spire.

4_Your deeds, Lord, made me glad.
I'll joy in what You've done.
5_How great Your do -- ings, Lord!
How deep Your thoughts each one!
6_Fools won't be shown;
The fool -- ish can't ac -- cept this truth,
To him un -- known!

7_Though sin -- ners grow like weeds,
Ill -- do -- ers blos -- som may,
8_They're doomed to be des -- troyed.
You, Lord, ex -- al -- ted stay.
9_Lord, Your foes fall.
See! How Your foes, vain e -- vil men,
Are scat -- tered all!

10_You've raised, like ox, my horn,
Poured fresh oil on my head.
11_You made me see the spies
And hear what plot -- ters said.
12_Like thriv -- ing palm
The right -- eous grows, like ced -- ars tall
On Leb -- a -- non.

13_Those plant -- ed by the Lord
Shall in God's courts be seen;
14_When old they'll still bear fruit
And flour -- ish flesh and green,
15_And loud pro -- claim
How up -- right is the Lord, my Rock;
No wrong in Him!
