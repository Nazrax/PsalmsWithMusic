O Lord, how are my foes increased!
Against me many rise.
How many say, "In vain for help
He on his God relies!"

You are my shield and glory, Lord;
You lifted up my head.
I cried out, "Lord!" and from His hill
To me His answer sped.

I lay down, slept, and woke again
The lord is keeping me.
I will not fear ten thousand men
Entrenched surrounding me.

Arise, O Lord! Save me, my God!
You punish all my foes.
You smite the face of wicked men,
Their teeth break with your blows.

Deliverance is from the Lord,
Salvation His alone!
O let Your blessing evermore
Be on Your people shown!
