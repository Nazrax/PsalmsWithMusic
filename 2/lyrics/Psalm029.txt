1_O give to Je -- ho -- vah, you sons of the Might -- y,
Both glo -- ry and strength to Je -- ho -- vah ac -- cord!
2_O give to the LORD His name's great -- ness of glo -- ry!
In splen -- dor of ho -- li -- ness wor -- ship the LORD!

3_The voice of Je -- ho -- vah re -- sounds on the wa -- ters;
The glor -- i -- ous God thun -- ders forth from the height.
The LORD is u -- pon the great sweep of the wa -- ters
4_The LORD's voice in splen -- dor! The LORD's voice in might!

5_The voice of Je -- ho -- vah is break -- ing the ce -- dars!
Je -- ho -- vah rips Le -- ba -- non's ce -- dars a -- part!
6_The slopes of Mount Her -- mon like calves they are leap -- ing!
And Le -- ba -- non's hills like young an -- te -- lope start!

7_The voice of Je -- ho -- vah di -- vides flames of light -- ning
And cau -- ses the fi -- er -- y flash -- es to break!
8_The voice of the LORD makes the wil -- der -- ness trem -- ble:
The LORD makes the des -- ert of Ka -- desh to shake!

9_The voice of the LORD makes the deer twist in la -- bor!
The high -- stand -- ing for -- est of trees it strips bare!
And all of the length and the breadth of His tem -- ple
And all things with -- in it His glo -- ry de -- clare!

10_The LORD on His throne sat a -- bove the great de -- luge!
The LORD on His throne sits as King with -- out cease!
11_The LORD is the One Who gives strength to His peo -- ple!
The LORD is the One Who will bless them with peace!
