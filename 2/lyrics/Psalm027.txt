Tune: St John
Name: Psalm 27

1_The Lord's my shin -- ing light
And my sal -- va -- tion sure;
Who can fill me with fright
Or move my heart se -- cure?
The Lord's my strong -- hold e -- ver near;
Of whom then shall I stand in fear?

2_When ad -- ver -- sar -- ies came
To eat my flesh a -- way,
Those wick -- ed tripped in shame,
And fell to their dis -- may.
3_Though hosts sur -- round, I will not quail;
And still I trust, though war as -- sail.

4_My one de -- sire has been,
Still to the Lord I'll pray,
That all my days with -- in
The Lord's house I may stay,
The Lord's own beau -- ty to ad -- mire,
And in His tem -- ple to in -- quire.

5_When troub -- les fill my day,
When fears and dang -- ers throng,
Se -- cur -- ely hid I'll stay
In His pa -- vil -- ion strong.
He'll hide me in His tent al -- ways;
And high u -- pon a rock me raise.

6_My head shall lift -- ed be
A -- bove my e -- nem -- ies.
With -- in His tent with glee
I'll of -- fer sac -- ri -- fice.
With shouts of joy my song I'll bring;
There prais -- es to the Lord I'll sing.

7_Lord, hear me when I cry!
O ans -- wer me in grace!
8_Each time I hear You say,
"\"En" -- quire and seek my "face.\""
My heart in glad res -- ponse will speak,
"\"Your" face, O Lord, I'll al -- ways "seek.\""

9_Hide not Your face from me,
Your ser -- vant now, I pray.
The day You ang -- ry be
O turn me not a -- way!
You've been my help. For -- sake me not!
God, my Sal -- va -- tion, leave me not!

10_Though par -- ents may be -- tray,
The Lord will care for me.
11_Teach me, O Lord, Your way,
On lev -- el path lead me.
For me my foes in am -- bush wait;
My way is lined with those who hate.

12_O to my foes' de -- sire
Hand me not o -- ver now!
They cun -- ning -- ly con -- spire
Their char -- ges false to vow.
Their ev -- ery breath is cr -- el -- ty;
How hope -- less seems my cause to be!

13_O had I not be -- lieved
That I would sure -- ly see
The good -- ness of the Lord
With those that liv -- ing be!
Wait for the Lord! With strength re -- stored,
Be brave in heart. Wait for the Lord.
