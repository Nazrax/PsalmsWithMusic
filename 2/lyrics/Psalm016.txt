name: Psalm 16
tune: Leominster

Pre -- serve me, O my God;
I put my trust in You.
Lord, I con -- fess, You are my Lord;
No good have I but You.
The god -- ly ones on earth,
Those ho -- ly in Your sight,
The no -- ble and ma -- jes -- tic ones,
Fill me with great de -- light.

Their sor -- rows mul -- ti -- ply
Who af -- ter i -- dols seek.
To them I'll no blood off' -- rings make;
Their names I'll ne -- ver speak.
The Lord the por -- tion is
Of my in -- her -- i -- tance.
He fills my cup, my lot pre -- pares,
Sec -- ures to me His grants.

The lines that fell to me
En -- close a pleas -- ant site.
The her -- i -- tage that I re -- ceived
To me is a de -- light.
I bless the Lord Who guides
With coun -- sel that is right.
My heart with -- in me He di -- rects
To teach me in the night.

I al -- ways keep the Lord
Be -- fore me, Him to see.
Be -- cause He is at my right hand
I ne -- ver moved shall be.
Thus glad -- ness fills my soul;
My joy must be ex -- pressed
With my whole be -- ing, for my flesh
Sec -- ur -- ely finds its rest.

My soul You will not leave
In death's dark pit to be.
Cor -- rup -- tion You will not per -- mit
Your Ho -- ly One to see.
The path of life You'll show;
Of joy You hold great store.
Be -- fore Your face, at Your right hand,
Are pleas -- ures ev -- er -- more.
