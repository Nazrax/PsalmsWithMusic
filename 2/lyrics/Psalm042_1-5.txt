name: Psalm 42 v1-5
tune: St Agnes

1_As in its thirst a faint -- ing hart
To wa -- ter brooks doth flee,
So pants my long -- ing soul, O God,
That I may come to Thee.

2_My soul for God, the liv -- ing God,
Is thirst -- ing; shall I near
Be -- fore the face of God ap -- proach
And in His sight ap -- pear?

3_My tears have un -- to me been food
Both in the night and day,
While un -- to me con -- tin -- ua -- lly,
'Where is your God?' they say.

4_Poured out with -- in me is my soul
When this I think u -- pon:
How of -- ten with the ea -- ger throng
I rev' -- rent -- ly had gone,

How to the house of God I went
With voice of joy and praise,
Yea, with the mul -- tit -- ude that kept
The sol -- emn ho -- ly days.

5_O why, my soul, art thou bowed down?
Why so dis -- cour -- aged be?
Hope now in God! I'll praise Him still!
My help, my God is He!
