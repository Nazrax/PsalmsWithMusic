tune: Duane Street LMD

1_How blest the blame -- less in their way
Who from God's law do not de -- part,
2_Who hold -- ing fast the word of truth,
Seek Him with un -- div -- id -- ed heart.
3_Yea, they are kept from paths of sin
Who walk in His ap -- point -- ed way;
4_Thy pre -- cepts Thou hast giv -- en us
That we should faith -- ful -- ly o -- bey.

5_My wav' -- ring heart is now re -- solved
Thy ho -- ly stat -- utes to ful -- fill;
6_No more shall I be brought to shame
When I re -- gard Thy ho -- ly will.
7_To Thee my praise sin -- cere shall rise
When I Thy right -- eous judg -- ments learn;
8_For -- sake me not, but be my guide,
And from Thy stat -- utes I'll not turn.

9_How shall a young man cleanse his way?
Let him with care Thy word ob -- serve.
10_With all my heart I have Thee sought;
From Thy com -- mands let me not swerve.
11_Thy word I've treas -- ured in my heart,
That I give no of -- fense to Thee.
12_Thou, O Je -- ho -- vah, bless -- ed art;
Thy stat -- utes teach Thou un -- to me.

13_I with my lips have oft de -- clared
The judg -- ments which Thy mouth has shown,
14_More joy Thy test -- i -- mon -- ies gave
Than all the rich -- es I have known.
15_I'll on Thy pre -- cepts med -- i -- tate,
And have res -- pect to all Thy ways.
16_I in Thy stat -- utes will de -- light,
Thy word re -- mem -- ber all my days.
