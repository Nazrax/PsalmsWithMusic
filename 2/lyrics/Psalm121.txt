name: Psalm 121
tune: Dundee

1_I to the hills will lift my eyes.
From whence shall come my aid?
2_My safe -- ty com -- eth from the LORD
Who heav'n and earth has made.

3_Thy foot He'll not let slide, nor will
He slum -- ber that thee keeps.
4_Lo, He that keep -- eth Is -- ra -- el,
He slum -- bers not nor sleeps.

5_The LORD thee keeps: the LORD thy shade
On thy right hand doth stay;
6_The moon by night thee shall not smite,
Nor yet the sun by day.

7_The LORD shall keep thee from all ill;
He shall pre -- serve thy soul.
8_The LORD as thou shalt go and come
For -- ev -- er keeps thee whole.
