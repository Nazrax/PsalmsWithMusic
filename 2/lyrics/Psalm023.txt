name: Psalm 23
tune: Crimond

The Lord's my Shep -- herd, I'll not want
He makes me down to lie
In pas -- tures green; He lead -- eth me
The qui -- et wa -- ters by.

My soul He doth re -- store a -- gain
And me to walk doth make
With -- in the paths of right -- eous -- ness,
Ev'n for His own name's sake.

Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
Yet will I fear no ill;
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me com -- fort still.

A ta -- ble Thou has fur -- nished me
In pres -- ence of my foes;
My head Thou dost with oil a -- noint,
And my cup o -- ver -- flows.

Good -- ness and mer -- cy all my life
Shall sure -- ly fol -- low me;
And in God's house for -- ev -- er -- more
My dwell -- ing place shall be.
