name: Psalm 42 v6-11
tune: St Agnes

6_O God, my soul's cast down in me;
I Thee re -- mem -- ber will
From Jor -- dan land, from Her -- mon's height,
And ev'n from Mi -- zar hill.

7_With thun -- der of Thy wa -- ter -- falls
Deep un -- to deep doth call;
Thy bil -- lows all roll o -- ver me;
On me Thy break -- ers fall.

8_And yet Je -- ho -- vah will com -- mand
His mer -- cy in the day;
By night His song shall be with me;
To God, my Life, I'll pray.

9_To God Who is my rock I'll say,
'O why for -- get me so?
Be -- neath op -- pres -- sion of my foes
Why do I mourn -- ing go?'

10_As with a sword with -- in my bones
My e -- nem -- ies up -- braid,
While un -- to me, 'Where is Thy God?'
Con -- tin -- ua -- lly is said.

11_O why, my soul, art thou bowed down?
Why so dis -- cour -- aged be?
Hope now in God! I'll praise Him still!
My Help, my God is He!
