tune: St Theodulph
name: Psalm 31 (1-16)

1_In You, LORD, I take re -- fuge;
A -- shamed let me not be.
Your right -- eous -- ness e -- ter -- nal
Ex -- press by sav -- ing me;
2_In -- cline Your ear to hear me;
With speed de -- liv -- er me.
To me O be a strong rock
A fort to res -- cue me.

3_You are my rock and fort -- ress;
For Your sake lead and guide.
4_Free me from nets they've hid -- den;
My strong -- hold You a -- bide.
5_I now com -- mit my spir -- it
In -- to Your out -- stretched hand.
I know You have re -- deemed me,
LORD God of truths that stand.

6_I hate those serv -- ing i -- dols;
My trust is in the LORD.
7_I'll tri -- umph in Your mer -- cy;
For ang -- uish You re -- gard.
You've known my soul's aff -- lict -- ions,
Kept me from hos -- tile hand.
8_My feet You have es -- tab -- lished
Where they have room to stand.

9_O LORD, have mer -- cy on me,
For ang -- uish fills my life;
My eye, my soul, my bo -- dy
Are all con -- sumed with grief.
10_My life is drained by sor -- row,
My years with sigh -- ing spent;
I've lost my strength by sin -- ning;
My bones are weak and bent.

11_To all my foes a by -- word,
A dread to those near me,
A scorn to all my neigh -- bors,
At sight of me they flee.
12_Like dead men I'm for -- gott -- en,
A brok -- en jar thrown out.
13_I've sland -- ers heard of ma -- ny,
And fear is all a -- bout.

When foes con -- spire a -- gainst me,
My mur -- der med -- i -- tate,
14_In You, O LORD, I'm trust -- ing;
"\"You" are my "God,\"" I state.
15_My times are all in Your hand;
Free me from foes who chase.
16_Your face shine on Your ser -- vant;
O save me in Your grace.
