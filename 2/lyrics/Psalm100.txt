name: Psalm 100
tune: Old 100th

All peo -- ple that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheer -- ful voice.
Him serve with mirth; His praise forth tell;
Come ye be -- fore Him and re -- joice.

Know that the Lord is God in -- deed;
With -- out our aid He did us make.
We are His folk; He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.

O en -- ter then His gates with praise;
With -- in His courts your thanks pro -- claim;
With grate -- ful hearts your voi -- ces raise
To bless and mag -- ni -- fy His name.

Be -- cause the Lord our God is good,
His mer -- cy is for -- ev -- er sure;
His truth at all times firm -- ly stood
And shall from age to age en -- dure.
