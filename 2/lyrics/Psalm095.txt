name: Psalm 95
tune: Irish

1_O come and to Je -- ho -- vah sing;
Let us our voic -- es raise;
In joy -- ful songs let us the Rock
Of our sal -- va -- tion praise.

2_Be -- fore His pres -- ence let us come
With praise and thank -- ful voice;
Let us sing psalms to Him with grace;
With shouts let us re -- joice.

3_The LORD's a might -- y God and King;
A -- bove all gods He is.
4_The depths of earth are in His hand;
The moun -- tain peaks are His.

5_To Him the spac -- ious sea be -- longs;
'Twas made by his com -- mand;
And by the work -- ings of His hands
He formed the ris -- ing land.

6_O come and let us wor -- ship Him;
Let us with one ac -- cord
In pres -- ence of our Maker kneel,
And bow be -- fore the LORD.

7_Be -- cause He only is our God,
And we His cho -- sen sheep,
The peo -- ple of His past -- ur -- age,
Whom His own hand will keep.

To -- day if you will hear His voice,
8_Then har -- den not your heart;
Strive not as those at Mer -- i -- bah,
Nor Mas -- sah's test -- ing start.

9_Your fath -- ers tried and tempt -- ed Me,
Though they My work per -- cei -- ved;
10_And with that gen -- er -- a -- tion I
For four -- ty years was grieved.

I said, "\"They" have a wand -- 'ring heart,
And they My ways "detest.\""
11_In wrath I swore they should not come
In -- to My prom -- ised rest.
