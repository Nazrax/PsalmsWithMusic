Answer when I call, O God who justifies.
In my stress You freed me; hear in grace my cries.
Sons of men, how long will you my glory shame?
Will you love what's worthless? Will lies be your aim?

Know the Lord His saints has set apart in grace,
And the Lord will hear me when I seek His face.
Tremble in your anger, yet from sin depart.
On your bed in silence speak within your heart.

May you sacrifice now sacrificies just.
In Jehovah only placing all your trust.
"Who will show us goodness?" many people say;
The light of Your face, Lord, lift on us, we pray.

You have given my heart greater joy by far
Than when grain and new wine most abundant are.
So in peace I lie down; I will rest and sleep,
For, O Lord, you only will me safely keep.

Penitence (In the hour of trial)
