tune: Aberystwyth
name: Psalm 5

1_O Je -- ho -- vah, hear my words;
To my thoughts at -- tent -- ive be.
2_Hear my cry, my King, my God,
For I make my prayer to Thee.
3_With the morn -- ing light, O LORD,
Thou shalt hear my voice and cry;
In the morn my prayer ar -- range
And keep con -- stant watch will I.

4_Tru -- ly, Thou art not a God
That in sin doth take de -- light;
E -- vil shall not dwell with Thee,
5_Nor the proud stand in Thy sight.
E -- vil -- do -- ers Thou dost hate;
6_Li -- ars Thou wilt bring to naught.
GOD ab -- hors the man who loves
Deed of blood or ly -- ing thought.

7_But in Thine a -- bund -- ant grace
To Thy house will I re -- pair;
Look -- ing to Thy ho -- ly place,
In Thy fear I'll wor -- ship there.
8_Since, O LORD, mine e -- nem -- ies
For my soul do lie in wait,
Lead me in Thy right -- eous -- ness;
Make Thy way be -- fore me straight.

9_For they flat -- ter with their tongue;
In their mouth no truth is found;
Like an o -- pen grave their throat;
All their thoughts with sin a -- bound.
10_Hold them guil -- ty, O my God;
Them for all their sins ex -- pel;
Let them fall by their own craft,
For a -- gainst Thee they re -- bel.

11_But let all that trust Thy care
E -- ver glad and joy -- ful be;
Let them joy who love Thy name,
For they guard -- ed are by Thee.
12_And a bless -- ing rich, O LORD,
To the right -- eous Thou wilt yield;
Thou wilt com -- pass him a -- bout
With Thy fa -- vor as a shield.
