name: Psalm 99

1_The Lord is King in -- deed!
Let peo -- ples quail and fear!
He sits a -- bove the cher -- u -- bim;
Let earth be moved!
2_The Lord in Zi -- on rules,
And o -- ver all is high;
3_O praise His great and dread -- ful name,
The Ho -- ly One!

4_The pow -- er of the King
De -- lights in e -- qui -- ty;
In Ja -- cob You es -- tab -- lish law
And right -- eous -- ness.
5_Ex -- alt and cel -- e -- brate
The Lord, Who is our God,
And at His foot -- stool wor -- ship Him,
The Ho -- ly One!

6_For Mo -- ses was His priest,
And Aa -- ron, too, did serve,
And Sam -- u -- el of them who called
U -- pon His name.
The Lord re -- ceived their cry;
7_He spoke from out the cloud.
His test -- i -- mon -- ies they o -- beyed;
They kept His laws.

8_O Lord our God, You heard,
And ans -- wer gave to them;
You were a God that bore them up
But judged their works!
9_Ex -- alt the Lord our God!
Bow to His ho -- ly hill!
Be -- hold, He is the Ho -- ly One,
The Lord our God!
