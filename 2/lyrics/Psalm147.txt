name: Psalm 147
tune: Lancashire

1_Praise God! 'Tis good and pleas -- ant,
And come -- ly to ad -- ore;
2_Je -- ho -- vah builds up Sa -- lem,
Her out -- casts doth re -- store.
3_He heals the bro -- ken -- heart -- ed,
And makes the wound -- ed live;
4_The star -- ry hosts He num -- bers,
And names to all doth give.

5_Our LORD is great and might -- y;
His wis -- dom none can know;
6_The LORD doth raise the low -- ly
And sin -- ners o -- ver -- throw.
7_O thank and praise Je -- ho -- vah!
Praise Him on harp with mirth,
8_The heav'n with clouds Who co -- vers,
And sends His rain on earth.

9_He clothes with grass the moun -- tains,
And gives the beasts their food;
He hears the cry -- ing ra -- vens,
And feeds their tender brood.
10_In horse's strength de -- lights not,
Nor speed of man loves He;
11_The LORD loves all who fear Him,
And to His mer -- cy flee.

12_O Sa -- lem, praise Je -- ho -- vah,
Thy God, O Zi -- on, praise;
13_For He thy gates has strength -- ened,
And blessed thy sons with grace.
14_With peace He'll bless thy bord -- ers,
The fin -- est wheat af -- ford,
15_He sends forth His com -- mand -- ment,
And swift -- ly speeds His word.

16_Like wool the snow He giv -- eth,
Spreads hail o'er all the land,
17_Hoar -- frost like ash -- es scat -- ters;
Who can His cold with -- stand?
18_Then forth His word He send -- eth,
He makes His wind to blow;
The snow and ice are melt -- ed,
A -- gain the wat -- ers flow.

19_The words that He has spok -- en
To Ja -- cob He makes known;
His judg -- ments and His stat -- utes
To Is -- ra -- el has shown.
20_Not so to a -- ny na -- tion
Did He His grace ac -- cord.
For they've not known His judg -- ments.
O do ye praise the Lord.
