Why do heathen nathions rage?
Why do peoples folly mind?
Kings of earth in plots engage.
Rulers are in league combined;
Then against Jehovah high,
And against Messiah's sway,
"Let us break their bands," they cry,
"Let us cast their cords away."

But the Lord will scorn them all;
He will laugh Who sits on high.
Then His wrath will on them fall;
Sore displeased He will reply:
"Yet according to My will
I have set My King to reighn,
And on Zion's holy hill
My Anointed I'll maintain."

His decree I will make known:
Unto Me the Lord did say,
"Thou art my beloved Son;
I've begotten Thee this day.
Ask of Me, and Thee I'll make
Heir to earth and nations all;
Them with iron Thou shalt break,
Dashing them in pieces small."

Therefore, kings, be wise, give ear;
Hearken, judges of the earth;
Serve the Lord with godly fear;
Mingle trembling ith your mirth.
Kiss the Son, His wrath to turn,
Lest ye perish in the way;
For His anger soon will burn.
Blessed are all that on Him stay.
