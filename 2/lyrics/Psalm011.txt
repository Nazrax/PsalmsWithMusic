tune: Terra Beata
name: Psalm 11

1_My trust is in the LORD;
How can you say to me,
"\"Now" like a bird from pe -- ril haste
And to your moun -- tain flee!
2_The wick -- ed bend the bow
With ar -- row fixed for flight,
And stealth -- i -- ly in dark -- ness go
The true in heart to smite.

3_"\"Found" -- a -- tions are dest -- royed!
What can the right -- eous "try?\""
4_The LORD is in His ho -- ly place;
The LORD's throne is on high.
His eyes will sure -- ly see,
His eye -- lids try men's sons.
5_The LORD tries just and wick -- ed men;
His soul hates cru -- el ones.

6_U -- pon all wick -- ed men
He'll rain en -- tangl -- ing snares.
Brim -- stone and fire and burn -- ing wind
He for their cup pre -- pares.
7_For right -- eous is the LORD,
And He loves right -- eous -- ness;
And e -- very one who up -- right is
Will see His grac -- ious face.
