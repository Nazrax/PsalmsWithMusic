name: Psalm 42
tune: St Agnes
double: 1

As in its thirst a faint -- ing hart
To wa -- ter brooks doth flee,
So pants my long -- ing soul, O God,
That I may come to Thee.
My soul for God, the liv -- ing God,
Is thirst -- ing; shall I near
Be -- fore the face of God ap -- proach
And in His sight ap -- pear?

My tears have un -- to me been food
Both in the night and day,
While un -- to me con -- tin -- ua -- lly,
'Where is your God?' they say.
Poured out with -- in me is my soul
When this I think u -- pon:
How of -- ten with the ea -- ger throng
I rev' -- rent -- ly had gone,

How to the house of God I went
With voice of joy and praise,
Yea, with the mul -- tit -- ude that kept
The sol -- emn ho -- ly days.
O why, my soul, art thou bowed down?
Why so dis -- cour -- aged be?
Hope now in God! I'll praise Him still!
My help, my God is He!

O God, my soul's cast down in me;
I Thee re -- mem -- ber will
From Jor -- dan land, from Her -- mon's height,
And ev'n from Mi -- zar hill.
With thun -- der of Thy wa -- ter -- falls
Deep un -- to deep doth call;
Thy bil -- lows all roll o -- ver me;
On me Thy break -- ers fall.

And yet Je -- ho -- vah will com -- mand
His mer -- cy in the day;
By night His song shall be with me;
To God, my Life, I'll pray.
To God Who is my rock I'll say,
'O why for -- get me so?
Be -- neath op -- pres -- sion of my foes
Why do I mourn -- ing go?'

As with a sword with -- in my bones
My e -- nem -- ies up -- braid,
While un -- to me, 'Where is Thy God?'
Con -- tin -- ua -- lly is said.
O why, my soul, art thou bowed down?
Why so dis -- cour -- aged be?
Hope now in God! I'll praise Him still!
My Help, my God is He!
