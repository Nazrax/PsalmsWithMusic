tune: Rockingham Old
name: Psalm 142

1_Un -- to the LORD my voice I raise,
Un -- to the LORD my voice now prays;
2_Be -- fore His face my grief I show
And tell my trou -- ble and my woe.

3_When gloom and sor -- row com -- pass me,
The path I take is known to Thee,
So are the snares that foes do lay
To snare Thy ser -- vant in his way.

4_All un -- pro -- tec -- ted, lo, I stand,
No friend -- ly guard -- ian at my hand,
No place of flight or ref -- uge near,
And none to whom my soul is dear.

5_O LORD, my Sav -- iour, now to Thee,
With -- out a hope be -- side, I flee,
To Thee, my shel -- ter from the strife;
My port -- ion in the land of life.

6_Be Thou my help when troub -- les throng,
For I am weak and foes are strong;
7_My capt -- ive soul from pri -- son bring,
And thanks to Thy name I will sing.

The right -- eous then shall gath -- er round
To share the bless -- ing I have found,
Their hearts made glad be -- cause they see
How rich -- ly Thou hast dealt with me.
